# My Friend Mykola in Moldova ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡©

*A volunteer project created to help Ukrainian refugees navigate life in Moldova*

## Overview

In 2022, during the critical early months of the Ukrainian refugee crisis, this website was created as a grassroots initiative to help Ukrainian families and children who found refuge in Moldova. The project was inspired by similar German initiatives but adapted specifically for the Moldovan context. 

**Note: This site is no longer active (http://mij-drug-mykola-u-moldovi.42web.io/) as the immediate crisis phase has passed, but the code remains as a testament to rapid humanitarian response.**

## Background & Crisis Context

When the war in Ukraine began in February 2022, Moldova - despite being one of Europe's smallest and poorest countries - opened its doors to hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees. The need for accessible, bilingual resources was urgent and critical. When I arrived in Moldova, I felt lost and decided to create this resource to practice the skills I had learned on my own.

This project was created by a 13-year-old developer (me) who recognized the immediate need for:
- Bilingual resources (Ukrainian/Moldovan)
- Child-friendly guidance and reassurance
- Practical information for daily life
- A sense of welcome and community

## Project Philosophy

The character "Mykola" (ÐœÐ¸ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð°) serves as a friendly guide - a digital friend who helps Ukrainian children and families feel welcomed and safe in their new temporary home. The approach was intentionally warm and personal, addressing the trauma and uncertainty refugees were experiencing.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Custom HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Backend**: Minimal PHP components
- **Deployment**: 42web.io hosting platform
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (first experience with automated deployment)

### Key Features
- Fully bilingual interface (Ukrainian/Moldovan)
- Mobile-responsive design using Bootstrap 4
- SEO-optimized with comprehensive meta tags and sitemap
- Custom 404 error page with Tic-Tac-Toe game
- Analytics integration for usage tracking

### Site Structure

## Impact & Reflection

While metrics are no longer available, this project served Ukrainian refugee families during their most vulnerable period. The initiative demonstrates how young developers can contribute meaningfully to humanitarian crises through technology.

The project also represents a first foray into professional development practices:
- Version control with Git
- Automated testing and deployment
- SEO and web performance optimization
- Multilingual web development

## Legacy

Though the immediate crisis has evolved and this particular resource is no longer maintained, the project stands as an example of:
- **Youth agency** in humanitarian response
- **Technology as a bridge** for displaced communities  
- **Rapid prototyping** under pressure
- **Cultural sensitivity** in design and content
